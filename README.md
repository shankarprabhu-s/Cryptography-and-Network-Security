# Cryptographic Algorithms Overview

This repository contains implementations of various cryptographic algorithms along with brief explanations of each.

## Caesar Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. It's a simple and widely-known encryption technique.

## Monoalphabetic Cipher
The Monoalphabetic cipher uses a fixed substitution for each letter in the plaintext. It's a basic substitution cipher where each character is mapped to another character in a one-to-one correspondence.

## Diffie-Hellman Algorithm
The Diffie-Hellman algorithm allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. It enables secure communication by generating a shared secret without needing to transmit it directly.

## Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a public-key cryptography technique based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. It's used for key generation, digital signatures, and encryption.

## Vigenère Cipher
The Vigenère cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to determine the shift for each letter in the plaintext. It provides stronger encryption than simple substitution ciphers by using multiple Caesar ciphers.

## Feistel Cipher
The Feistel cipher is a symmetric structure used in the construction of block ciphers. It divides the block into two halves and applies multiple rounds of encryption and decryption using a round function.

## Hill Cipher
The Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra. It operates on blocks of plaintext and uses matrix multiplication for encryption and decryption.

## Playfair Cipher
The Playfair cipher is a symmetric encryption technique that uses a 5x5 matrix of letters to encrypt pairs of letters in the plaintext. It's known for its simplicity and effectiveness.

## Data Encryption Standard (DES)
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key algorithm for encrypting and decrypting data. It uses a 56-bit key and operates on blocks of data. The key generation process creates the necessary round keys used in the encryption and decryption process.

## RSA Encryption
RSA is a public-key encryption algorithm widely used for secure data transmission. It uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It relies on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers for its security.
